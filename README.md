## Overview

The system is designed to perform the following tasks:  
1. **Number Plate Detection:**  
   - A **pretrained YOLO model** is used to detect the number plate from an image of a vehicle.  
   
2. **Character Detection in Number Plate:**  
   - A second **YOLO model**, trained on the **Inspiring Lab dataset**, detects individual characters in the number plate. This dataset contains images of Nepali license plates, making the model well-suited for this task.  

3. **Character Recognition:**  
   - Detected characters are cropped from the number plate image and fed into a **custom-built CNN model**.  
   - This CNN model, trained on the **Inspiring Lab dataset** (which includes characters frequently used in Nepali number plates), identifies the characters.

## Key Features

- **Pretrained YOLO Model:** Efficiently detects number plates from vehicle images.  
- **Custom YOLO Model:** Specifically trained to detect characters on Nepali license plates.  
- **Custom CNN Model:** Designed for character recognition using data tailored to the Nepali context.  
- **Dataset:** Utilizes the **Inspiring Lab dataset**, ensuring high accuracy for the unique structure of Nepali license plates.

## Methodology

1. **Number Plate Detection:**  
   - The pretrained YOLO model takes an image of a vehicle and identifies the region containing the number plate.

2. **Character Detection:**  
   - The custom YOLO model identifies individual characters in the detected number plate region.  
   - Detected characters are cropped for further processing.

3. **Character Recognition:**  
   - Cropped characters are passed to the custom-built CNN model, which outputs the recognized character.  
   - The CNN model is trained on a dataset of characters commonly used in Nepali number plates to ensure high recognition accuracy.
